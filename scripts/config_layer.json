Polygons for projects represent the project footprint (i.e. land area comprising the project site) or area of primary impact. Polygons for markets represent the entire region that shares market infrastructure and rules, or a larger program encompassing many smaller projects, such as habitat exchanges. Points represent the centroids of market and project polygons with the exception of national markets, whose points represent administrative headquarters

Polygons for projects represent the project footprint (i.e. land area comprising the project site) or area of primary impact. Polygons for markets represent the entire region that shares market infrastructure and rules, or a larger program encompassing many smaller projects, such as in-lieu fee programs. Points represent the centroids of market and project polygons with the exception of national markets, whose points represent administrative headquarters locations.","DownloadSource":"ftp://newftp.epa.gov/epadatacommons/ORD/EnviroAtlas/Ecosystem_Marketplace_Shapefiles_November2016.zip","eaID":275,"eaBCSDD":["Biodiversity Conservation - x","Clean and

For Publicly Owned Treatment Works (POTWs), Major dischargers include all facilities with design flows equal to or greater than one million gallons per day, or serve a population of 10,000 or more, or cause significant water quality impacts. Non-POTW discharges are classified as Major facilities on the basis of the number of points accumulated using a Rating worksheet, which evaluates the significance of a facility using several criteria, including toxic pollutant potential, flow volume, and water quality factors such as impairment of the receiving water or proximity of the discharge to coastal waters. Updated as source data is updated, typically monthly.","DownloadSource":"https://www.epa.gov/frs","eaID":774,"autorefresh":0,"type":"FEATURE","eaLyrNum":0,"popup":{"fieldInfos":[{"fieldName":"OBJECTID","visible":false,"tooltip":"","label":"OBJECTID","stringFieldOption":"textbox"},{"fieldName":"SHAPE","visible":false,"tooltip":"","label":"SHAPE","stringFieldOption":"textbox"},{"fieldName":"REGISTRY_ID","visible":true,"tooltip":"","label":"REGISTRY_ID","stringFieldOption":"textbox"},{"fieldName":"PRIMARY_NAME","visible":true,"tooltip":"","label":"PRIMARY_NAME","stringFieldOption":"textbox"},{"fieldName":"LOCATION_ADDRESS","visible":true,"tooltip":"","label":"LOCATION_ADDRESS","stringFieldOption":"textbox"},{"fieldName":"CITY_NAME","visible":true,"tooltip":"","label":"CITY_NAME","stringFieldOption":"textbox"},{"fieldName":"COUNTY_NAME","visible":true,"tooltip":"","label":"COUNTY_NAME","stringFieldOption":"textbox"},{"fieldName":"FIPS_CODE","visible":true,"tooltip":"","label":"FIPS_CODE","stringFieldOption":"textbox"},{"fieldName":"STATE_CODE","visible":true,"tooltip":"","label":"STATE_CODE","stringFieldOption":"textbox"},{"fieldName":"POSTAL_CODE","visible":true,"tooltip":"","label":"POSTAL_CODE","stringFieldOption":"textbox"},{"fieldName":"LATITUDE83","format":{"places":2,"digitSeparator":true},"stringFieldOption":"textbox","visible":true,"tooltip":"","label":"LATITUDE83"},{"fieldName":"LONGITUDE83","format":{"places":2,"digitSeparator":true},"stringFieldOption":"textbox","visible":true,"tooltip":"","label":"LONGITUDE83"},{"fieldName":"HUC8_CODE","visible":true,"tooltip":"","label":"HUC8_CODE","stringFieldOption":"textbox"},{"fieldName":"ACCURACY_VALUE","format":{"places":0,"digitSeparator":true},"stringFieldOption":"textbox","visible":true,"tooltip":"","label":"ACCURACY_VALUE"},{"fieldName":"COLLECT_MTH_DESC","visible":true,"tooltip":"","label":"COLLECT_MTH_DESC","stringFieldOption":"textbox"},{"fieldName":"REF_POINT_DESC","visible":true,"tooltip":"","label":"REF_POINT_DESC","stringFieldOption":"textbox"},{"fieldName":"CREATE_DATE","format":{"dateFormat":"shortDateShortTime"},"stringFieldOption":"textbox","visible":true,"tooltip":"","label":"CREATE_DATE"},{"fieldName":"UPDATE_DATE","format":{"dateFormat":"shortDateShortTime"},"stringFieldOption":"textbox","visible":true,"tooltip":"","label":"UPDATE_DATE"},{"fieldName":"LAST_REPORTED_DATE","format":{"dateFormat":"shortDateShortTime"},"stringFieldOption":"textbox","visible":true,"tooltip":"","label":"LAST_REPORTED_DATE"},{"fieldName":"FAC_URL","visible":true,"tooltip":"","label":"FAC_URL","stringFieldOption":"textbox"},{"fieldName":"PGM_SYS_ID","visible":true,"tooltip":"","label":"PGM_SYS_ID","stringFieldOption":"textbox"},{"fieldName":"PGM_SYS_ACRNM","visible":true,"tooltip":"","label":"PGM_SYS_ACRNM","stringFieldOption":"textbox"},{"fieldName":"INTEREST_TYPE","visible":true,"tooltip":"","label":"INTEREST_TYPE","stringFieldOption":"textbox"},{"fieldName":"ACTIVE_STATUS","visible":true,"tooltip":"","label":"ACTIVE_STATUS","stringFieldOption":"textbox"}],"showAttachments":true,"mediaInfos":[],"title":"NPDES - Major: {PRIMARY_NAME}","description":null,"geometrytype":"point"},"name":"Permitted Water Dischargers - Major (NPDES)","opacity":0.6,"areaGeog":["CONUS","Alaska","Hawaii","Puerto Rico","Virgin Islands"],"visible":false,"eaTopic":"Sites Reporting to EPA ","sourceType":"plp","mode":"ondemand","eaTags":["Brownfields","Superfund","Hazardous Waste","NPDES","Water Dischargers","Point Sources","TRI","Air Pollution","Regulated","Facilities","EPA","Environmental Protection Agency","Pollution","Pollutants","Air Quality","Water Quality","health","safety","contaminated","contaminants","emergencies","emergency","hazardous waste","hazard","waste","cleanups","remediation"],"eaPBS":"Sites Reporting to EPA ","eaMetric":"foundational","eaDfsLink":"Supplemental/EPARegulatedFacilitiesWaterDischargers.pdf","url":"https://services.arcgis.com/cJ9YHowT8TU7DUyn/arcgis/rest/services/FRS_INTERESTS_NPDES_MAJOR/FeatureServer","categoryTab":"PSI"},{"eaScale":"NATIONAL","tileLink":"no","eaMetadata":"N087","eaDescription":"This dataset includes data from facilities reporting to EPA - Hazardous Waste: Shows points from the RCRAINFO (Resource Conservation and Recovery Act Information) program (All points, Active sites, Inactive sites, Large Quantity Generators (LQG), Transporters, and Treaters, Storers, and Disposers (TSD)).
