<p>Demographic Layers include national U.S. Census spatial data layers from the 2010 and 2000 decennial censuses as well as the 2012-2016 American Community Survey. Data are available at state, county, and census block group resolutions, with some layers available at the census block level.</p>
<hr>
<p>Use the dropdown menus to select the desired demographic layer. Click on the circled i to view descriptions of the data choices.</p>

<p>Style the data layer using the controls provided. Click on the circled i next to the style options to view descriptions of the style choices. You may also style the layer after you add it to the map.</p>

<p>Click Add to Map to add the data layer to the map.</p>
<hr>
<p>The resolution of a demographic layer is based on the map extent. Open the Layer List to view all layers displayed in the map. Click the name of the demographic layer to reveal the resolutions available for the layer. The resolution displayed in the map is represented by a checked blue box.</p>

<hr>
<p>If the map extent is set to the contiguous U.S., the data are displayed at the county level. A continental map extent will display data at the state level, and a county extent will display data at the tract or block group level depending on the size of the county.</p>
<p>To display the high-resolution levels for the layer (tract, block group, or block), zoom to an area of interest then click the Add to Map button. The map will display the resolution that corresponds to the zoom level and map extent. You may check the boxes in the Layer List for additional resolutions to display, and uncheck resolutions that are not wanted.</p>
