      <h1>Demographic Layers</h1>
      <p><strong>Demographic Layers</strong> include national U.S. Census spatial data layers from the 2010 and 2000 decennial censuses as well as the 2013-2017 American Community Survey. Data are available at state, county, and census block group resolutions, with some layers available at the census block level.</p>
      <ul>
		<li>Select demographic layer to display in the map</li>
		<li>If desired, customize the layer's appearance in the map - set the colors and data classification</li>
		<li>Add layer to the map</li>
      </ul>
	  <p>The resolution of a demographic layer is based on the map extent. If the map extent is set to the contiguous U.S., the data are displayed at the county level. A continental map extent will display data at the state level, and a county extent will display data at the tract or block group level depending on the size of the county. Zooming in or out of the map will adjust the resolution of the demographic display.</p>
