      The ECAT pop-up contains several adjustable parameters. The parameters provide the variables that control the climate comparison displayed on the map. The parameters are as follows:
   </p>
   <ol>
      <li>
         <strong>Climate Scenario </strong>&ndash; Click the <strong>circular </strong>&ldquo;<strong>i</strong>&rdquo; <strong>icon</strong> to review the model differences, then select the desired scenario.
      </li>
      <li>
         <strong>Starting year for baseline </strong>&ndash; the &ldquo;baseline&rdquo; is the year or period of consecutive years that will be compared to a comparison year (or period) to reveal changes in the climate variable over time. <i>If the baseline is a period of multiple consecutive years, this should be the first year of the baseline period.</i>
      </li>
      <li>
         <strong>Ending year for baseline</strong> &ndash; select the year that marks the end of the baseline period. The ending year must be equal to or later than the starting year. If the baseline is only one year, select the same year as the starting year.
      </li>
      <li>
         <strong>Starting year for comparison</strong> &ndash; the &ldquo;comparison&rdquo; is the year or period of consecutive years that will be compared to the baseline year (or period). If the comparison is a period of multiple consecutive years, this should be the first year of the comparison period.
      </li>
      <li>
         <strong>Ending year for comparison</strong> &ndash; select the year that marks the end of the comparison period. The ending year must be equal to or later than the starting year. If the comparison is only one year, select the same year as the starting year.
      </li>
      <li>
         <strong>Climate variable</strong> &ndash; select the metric (temperature, precipitation, etc.) to be mapped.
      </li>
      <li>
         <strong>Season or Annual</strong> &ndash; select the season to be mapped, or &ldquo;Annual&rdquo; for annual mean values.
      </li>
   </ol>
   <p>
      Once the parameters have been selected, click the <strong>Calculate Change</strong> button in the ECAT pop-up.
   </p>
   <br>
   <p>
      <em>Note:</em><em>The calculation may take several minutes to complete. While calculations run in the background, other aspects of the EnviroAtlas interactive map may continue to be used. </em>
   </p>
   </br>

   <p>
      Once complete, the map displays a layer of grid cells (800-meter resolution) detailing the change in the climate variable selected between the baseline year or period and the comparison year or period. The example above depicts the change in maximum temperature in summer when comparing the baseline period of 1950-1980 to the comparison period of 2020-2050. Clicking on a location on the map provides a pop-up that identifies the amount of change at the location. This example shows that the clicked location will experience an estimated maximum temperature increase of 3.97&deg; F in 2020-50 versus the baseline period of 1950-1980.
   </p>
   <br>
   <p>
      Open the Layer List to view the ranges of values that each color represents in the ECAT map. If desired, use the transparency slider bar to adjust the transparency of the new layer so that features below the layer are visible.
   </p>
   </br>
	<img style="width:530px; margin-right:5px" src='widgets/Demo/images/ECAT4.PNG'></p>
   <p>
      To remove the ECAT layer from the map, click the <strong>Clear Layers</strong> button in the ECAT pop-up. Alternatively, you may remove the ECAT layer from the Layer List.
   </p>
   <br>
   <p>
      The <strong>Download HUC12 average values (CSV) </strong>button creates a comma-separated value (CSV) file with the average of all ECAT values within each USGS 12-digit HUC in the conterminous U.S.
	  	<img style="width:330px; margin-right:5px" src='widgets/Demo/images/ECAT5.PNG'></p>
   </br>
   <p>
	  When the button is clicked, a pop-up opens to save the CSV file. The resulting CSV may be viewed in a text editor or in a spreadsheet. The file contains the following fields:
   </p>
   <ul>
      <li>
         <strong>OID</strong> &ndash; identifier used for processing.
      </li>
      <li>
         <strong>HUC_12 </strong>&ndash; 12-digit HUC identifier.
      </li>
      <li>
         <strong>ZONE_CODE</strong> &ndash; identifier used for processing.
      </li>
      <li>
         <strong>COUNT </strong>&ndash; the number of ECAT grid cells within the HUC used to calculate the mean value.
      </li>
      <li>
         <strong>AREA</strong> &ndash; area of the HUC (square meters).
      </li>
      <li>
         <strong>MEAN</strong> &ndash;average value of the climate variable grid cells within the HUC.
      </li>
   </ul>
   <p>
      <em>Note:&nbsp; ECAT tool parameters used to generate the CSV are not stored in the CSV output. It is recommended that the tool parameters be captured (i.e. by adding a written description in the CSV or via screen capture) to record the scenario selected.</em>
