       Elevation data are based on terrain data collected by the <a href="http://www2.jpl.nasa.gov/srtm/" class="demoLink">NASA Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) [Exit EPA]</a>. To generate an elevation profile, perform the following:
   </p>
   <ol>
      <li>
         Click the ruler icon <img style='height:16px' src='widgets/Demo/images/ElevationProfileDistance.png'> in the Measure tab in the Elevation Profile pop-up.
      </li>
      <li>
         The units dropdown appears to the right of the Distance tool and provides a selection of measurement units <en>for the transect</en>. Select the desired units.
      </li>
   <p>
      <em>Note: Upon execution, the resulting elevation units will correspond to the units you select here for the transect line. Selecting a metric measurement unit (kilometers or meters) will return elevation units in meters. Selecting an Imperial measurement unit (miles, yards, or feet) will return elevation units in Imperial units.</em>
   </p>
      <li>
         Create a transect line in the map:
	  <ul>
		<li>Single mouse click starts the transect and creates vertices along the transect.</li>
		<li>Double mouse click ends the transect line.</li>
	  </ul>
      </li>
   </ol>
   <p>
      The transect will appear as a blue line with markers indicating the beginning and ending points, as well as vertices along the profile transect.

   <p>
      Upon completing the transect, the elevation profile graph displays in the Profile Result tab in the Elevation Profile pop-up. Hover the mouse pointer over the profile graph to see the distance along the profile and the elevation value at a particular point, marked with a red X. The red X also appears along the transect line showing the relationship between the graph and the location on the map. Hover over the <strong>blue circular </strong>&ldquo;<strong>i</strong>&rdquo; <strong>icon</strong> (Profile Information) in the pop-up to get statistics about the profile.
