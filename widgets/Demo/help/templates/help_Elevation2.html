      The <strong>Elevation Profile</strong> tool generates an elevation profile graph based on a transect line interactively drawn in the map. The elevation data are reported in units above mean sea level and are based on topographic data collected by the <a href="http://www2.jpl.nasa.gov/srtm/">NASA Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM)</a>.
   </p>
   <p>
      To generate an elevation profile, perform the following:
   </p>
   <ol>
      <li>
         Click the Measure tool button from the Measure tab in the Elevation Profile pop-up.
      </li>
      <li>
         The units dropdown appears to the right of the Measure tool and provides a selection of measurement units. Select the measurement units.
      </li>
      <li>
         Create the transect line in the map. Click once at the desired beginning point of the profile transect. Multiple points may be added along the transect.
      </li>
      <li>
         At the ending point of the transect, double click.
      </li>
   </ol>
   <p>
      The transect will appear as a blue line with markers indicating the beginning and ending points of the profile transect.
   </p>
   <p>
      Upon completing the transect, the elevation profile graph displays in the Profile Result tab in the Elevation Profile pop-up. Hover the mouse pointer over the profile graph to see the distance along the profile and the elevation value at a particular point, marked with a red X. The red X also appears along the transect line showing the relationship between the graph and the location on the map. Hover over the <strong>blue circular </strong>&ldquo;<strong>i</strong>&rdquo; <strong>icon</strong> (Profile Information) in the pop-up to get statistics about the profile.
