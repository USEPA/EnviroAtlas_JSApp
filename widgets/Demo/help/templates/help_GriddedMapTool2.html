<p>Select the <strong>unit area</strong> from the dropdown:</p>
	<img style="width:430px; margin-right:5px" src='widgets/Demo/images/GriddedMapTool2.PNG'></p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>County</strong> &ndash; select a county.</li>
	<li><strong>State</strong> &ndash; select a state.</li>
	<li><strong>Congressional District</strong> &ndash; select a Congressional District.</li>
	<li><strong>HUC-8</strong> &ndash; select a HUC8 subwatershed. <em>Note: zoom in to view HUC boundaries.</em></li>
	<li><strong>HUC-12</strong> &ndash; select a HUC12 subwatershed. <em>Note: zoom in to view HUC boundaries.</em></li>
	<li><strong>Draw a point</strong> &ndash; click to create a point in the map and designate a buffer area around it.</li>
	<li><strong>Draw a line</strong> &ndash; draw a line in the map and designate a buffer area around it.</li>
	<li><strong>Draw an area</strong> &ndash; draw an area in the map. Optionally designate a buffer area around it.</li>
	<li><strong>Use your own shapefile</strong> &ndash; upload your own shapefile.</li>
</ul>	

<p><strong>Select</strong>, <strong>Create</strong>, or <strong>Upload</strong> the focus location interactively in the map:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Select</strong> a focus location on the map using the <strong>County</strong>, <strong>State</strong>, <strong>Congressional District</strong>, <strong>HUC-8</strong>, or <strong>HUC-12</strong> options:</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Click the selected focus location from the layer in the map. Zooming in on the map may be necessary to find the appropriate location. Only one focus location may be selected.</li>
	</ul>
	<li><strong>Create</strong> a focus location area on the map using the <strong>Draw a point</strong>, <strong>Draw a line</strong>, or <strong>Draw an area</strong> options:</li>
	<ul>
		<li>To <strong>Draw a point</strong>, first set the <strong>buffer measurement units (km or mi)</strong> and <strong>buffer distance</strong> in the tool. Then in the map, click the mouse button at the desired focus location. The focus location area will appear in the map as a circle, centered on the clicked point, with a radius equal to the buffer distance.</li>
	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li>To <strong>Draw a line</strong>, first set the <strong>buffer measurement units</strong> and <strong>buffer distance</strong> in the tool. Then in the map, click the mouse button and hold down to draw a freehand line. Let go of the mouse button to finish the line. The focus location will appear as an area on the map following the linear path drawn, buffered by the buffer distance.</li>
	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li>To <strong>Draw an area</strong>, optionally set the <strong>buffer measurement units</strong> and <strong>buffer distance</strong> in the tool. Check the box to exclude inner features of the area, if desired. Click the mouse button and hold down to draw a freehand focus location area in the map. Let go of the mouse button to finish the drawing. The focus location area will appear, including the buffer if selected.</li>
	</ul>
	<li><strong>Upload</strong> a zipped shapefile to create a focus location area on the map:</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Click <strong>Choose File</strong> to navigate to a polygon-type shapefile stored on a local computer.</li>
		<li>The uploaded geographic shape will appear in the map as the focus location.</li>
	</ul>
</ul>	

<p>In the example below, the National Land Cover Dataset (NLCD) is selected as the <strong>national indicator</strong> from the dropdown. For this indicator, choices for <strong>NLCD Layer Year</strong> are presented in a separate dropdown. Year 2016 is selected. County is selected as the <strong>unit area</strong>, and County boundaries are displayed in the map.</p>

<p>In the map, click a County to designate the <strong>focus location</strong> to analyze. The EnviroAtlas map zooms to the extent of the County, in this case Sweet Grass, Montana. The <strong>Calculate</strong> button becomes active.</p>
	<img style="width:530px; margin-right:5px" src='widgets/Demo/images/GriddedMapTool4.PNG'></p>

<p>Click <strong>Calculate</strong>. The Gridded Map Tool extracts the statistics (Area and Percentage for each 2016 NLCD Land Cover Type) within Sweet Grass County. Statistics appear in a table in the Tool's <strong>Results</strong> tab. Scroll through or resize the Gridded Map Tool window to view values in the table. Click <strong>Print</strong> to export a graphic image of the table.</p>
