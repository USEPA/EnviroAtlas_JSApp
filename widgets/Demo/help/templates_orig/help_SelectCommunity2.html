      You may select how to view community data layers in the map. Community layers are represented by a "C" icon in the layer selection panel on the left as well as in the Layer List. Your selection controls how the community data layers are displayed in the map as follows:
   </p>
   <ul>
      <li>
         <strong>Combined Communities</strong> &ndash; The default, displays the legend based on all communities (i.e., comparable across all communities)
      </li>
      <li>
         <strong>Individual community</strong> &ndash; Displays the legend for the selected community's data only.
      </li>
   </ul>
   <p>
      Select the community interactively in the map or by using the Community Selection tool.
