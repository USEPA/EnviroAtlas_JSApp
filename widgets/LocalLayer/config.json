Wetland restoration could help restore these benefits. Potential wetland areas, as developed for this map, are lands that naturally accumulate water due to topography and have historically had poorly or very poorly draining soils. This dataset was produced by the US EPA to support research and online mapping activities related to the EnviroAtlas.

Polygons for markets represent the entire region that shares market infrastructure and rules, or a larger program encompassing many smaller projects, such as in-lieu fee programs. Points represent the centroids of market and project polygons with the exception of national markets, whose points represent administrative headquarters
