Wetland restoration could help restore these benefits.

This dataset was produced by the US EPA to support research and online mapping activities related to the EnviroAtlas.

The dataset is available as downloadable data (https://edg.epa.gov/data/Public/ORD/EnviroAtlas) or as an EnviroAtlas map service.
