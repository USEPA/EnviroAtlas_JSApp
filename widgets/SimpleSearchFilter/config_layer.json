For Publicly Owned Treatment Works (POTWs), Major dischargers include all facilities with design flows equal to or greater than one million gallons per day, or serve a population of 10,000 or more, or cause significant water quality impacts. Non-POTW discharges are classified as Major facilities on the basis of the number of points accumulated using a Rating worksheet, which evaluates the significance of a facility using several criteria, including toxic pollutant potential, flow volume, and water quality factors such as impairment of the receiving water or proximity of the discharge to coastal waters. Updated as source data is updated, typically monthly.","eaLyrNum":12,"eaID":774,"eaMetadata":"N086","categoryTab":"PSI","eaTags":["Brownfields","Superfund","Hazardous Waste","NPDES","Water Dischargers","Point Sources","TRI","Air Pollution","Regulated","Facilities","EPA","Environmental Protection Agency","Pollution","Pollutants","Air Quality","Water Quality","health","safety","contaminated","contaminants","emergencies","emergency","hazardous waste","hazard","waste","cleanups","remediation"],"eaScale":"NATIONAL"},{"popup":{"geometrytype":"point","title":"RCRA: {PRIMARY_NAME}","fieldInfos":[{"label":"OBJECTID","stringFieldOption":"textbox","tooltip":"","visible":false,"fieldName":"OBJECTID"},{"label":"SHAPE","stringFieldOption":"textbox","tooltip":"","visible":false,"fieldName":"SHAPE"},{"label":"REGISTRY_ID","stringFieldOption":"textbox","tooltip":"","visible":true,"fieldName":"REGISTRY_ID"},{"label":"PRIMARY_NAME","stringFieldOption":"textbox","tooltip":"","visible":true,"fieldName":"PRIMARY_NAME"},{"label":"LOCATION_ADDRESS","stringFieldOption":"textbox","tooltip":"","visible":true,"fieldName":"LOCATION_ADDRESS"},{"label":"CITY_NAME","stringFieldOption":"textbox","tooltip":"","visible":true,"fieldName":"CITY_NAME"},{"label":"COUNTY_NAME","stringFieldOption":"textbox","tooltip":"","visible":true,"fieldName":"COUNTY_NAME"},{"label":"FIPS_CODE","stringFieldOption":"textbox","tooltip":"","visible":true,"fieldName":"FIPS_CODE"},{"label":"STATE_CODE","stringFieldOption":"textbox","tooltip":"","visible":true,"fieldName":"STATE_CODE"},{"label":"POSTAL_CODE","stringFieldOption":"textbox","tooltip":"","visible":true,"fieldName":"POSTAL_CODE"},{"label":"LATITUDE83","stringFieldOption":"textbox","format":{"digitSeparator":true,"places":2},"visible":true,"fieldName":"LATITUDE83","tooltip":""},{"label":"LONGITUDE83","stringFieldOption":"textbox","format":{"digitSeparator":true,"places":2},"visible":true,"fieldName":"LONGITUDE83","tooltip":""},{"label":"HUC8_CODE","stringFieldOption":"textbox","tooltip":"","visible":true,"fieldName":"HUC8_CODE"},{"label":"ACCURACY_VALUE","stringFieldOption":"textbox","format":{"digitSeparator":true,"places":0},"visible":true,"fieldName":"ACCURACY_VALUE","tooltip":""},{"label":"COLLECT_MTH_DESC","stringFieldOption":"textbox","tooltip":"","visible":true,"fieldName":"COLLECT_MTH_DESC"},{"label":"REF_POINT_DESC","stringFieldOption":"textbox","tooltip":"","visible":true,"fieldName":"REF_POINT_DESC"},{"label":"CREATE_DATE","stringFieldOption":"textbox","format":{"dateFormat":"shortDateShortTime"},"visible":true,"fieldName":"CREATE_DATE","tooltip":""},{"label":"UPDATE_DATE","stringFieldOption":"textbox","format":{"dateFormat":"shortDateShortTime"},"visible":true,"fieldName":"UPDATE_DATE","tooltip":""},{"label":"LAST_REPORTED_DATE","stringFieldOption":"textbox","format":{"dateFormat":"shortDateShortTime"},"visible":true,"fieldName":"LAST_REPORTED_DATE","tooltip":""},{"label":"FAC_URL","stringFieldOption":"textbox","tooltip":"","visible":true,"fieldName":"FAC_URL"},{"label":"PGM_SYS_ID","stringFieldOption":"textbox","tooltip":"","visible":true,"fieldName":"PGM_SYS_ID"},{"label":"PGM_SYS_ACRNM","stringFieldOption":"textbox","tooltip":"","visible":true,"fieldName":"PGM_SYS_ACRNM"},{"label":"INTEREST_TYPE","stringFieldOption":"textbox","tooltip":"","visible":true,"fieldName":"INTEREST_TYPE"},{"label":"ACTIVE_STATUS","stringFieldOption":"textbox","tooltip":"","visible":true,"fieldName":"ACTIVE_STATUS"}],"mediaInfos":[],"showAttachments":true,"description":null},"name":"Hazardous Waste Sites (RCRA)","type":"FEATURE","eaPBS":"Sites Reporting to EPA ","visible":false,"sourceType":"plp","opacity":0.6,"DownloadSource":"https://www.epa.gov/frs","eaDfsLink":"Supplemental/EPARegulatedFacilitiesHazardousWaste.pdf","eaMetric":"foundational","url":"https://gispub.epa.gov/arcgis/rest/services/OEI/FRS_INTERESTS/MapServer","eaTopic":"Sites Reporting to EPA ","mode":"ondemand","autorefresh":0,"areaGeog":["CONUS"],"tileLink":"no","eaDescription":"This dataset includes data from facilities reporting to EPA - Hazardous Waste: Shows points from the RCRAINFO (Resource Conservation and Recovery Act Information) program (All points, Active sites, Inactive sites, Large Quantity Generators (LQG), Transporters, and Treaters, Storers, and Disposers (TSD)).
