To convert pollutant loadings into TWPE, EPA multiplies the pollutant mass (in pounds) by its pollutant specific toxic weighting factor (TWF). Not all pollutants have a toxic weighting factor(for example, Total Suspended Solids), which means that these pollutants do not have a toxicity score (i.e., TWPE = 0).

For Publicly Owned Treatment Works (POTWs), Major dischargers include all facilities with design flows equal to or greater than one million gallons per day, or serve a population of 10,000 or more, or cause significant water quality impacts. Non-POTW discharges are classified as Major facilities on the basis of the number of points accumulated using a Rating worksheet, which evaluates the significance of a facility using several criteria, including toxic pollutant potential, flow volume, and water quality factors such as impairment of the receiving water or proximity of the discharge to coastal waters.
