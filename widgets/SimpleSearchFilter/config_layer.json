dataset contains polygons and points representing the location of markets and projects primarily targeting imperiled species and/or habitat ecosystem services per USACE RIBITS data and Ecosystem

Polygons for projects represent the project footprint (i.e. land area comprising the project site) or area of primary impact. Polygons for markets represent the entire region that shares market infrastructure and rules, or a larger program encompassing many smaller projects, such as habitat exchanges. Points represent the centroids of market and project polygons with the exception of national markets, whose points represent administrative headquarters

research. Polygons for projects represent the project footprint (i.e. land area comprising the project site) or area of primary impact. Polygons for markets represent the entire region that shares market infrastructure and rules, or a larger program encompassing many smaller projects, such as in-lieu fee programs. Points represent the centroids of market and project polygons with the exception of national markets, whose points represent administrative headquarters locations.","categoryTab":"ESB","DownloadSource":"ftp://newftp.epa.gov/epadatacommons/ORD/EnviroAtlas/Ecosystem_Marketplace_Shapefiles_November2016.zip","name":"Wetlands and Streams - Projects and

Polygons for projects represent the area of primary impact. Polygons for markets represent the entire region that shares market infrastructure and rules, or a larger program encompassing many smaller projects. Points represent the centroids of forest carbon markets and lat/lon locations of forest carbon projects with the exception of national markets, whose points represent administrative headquarters

To convert pollutant loadings into TWPE, EPA multiplies the pollutant mass (in pounds) by its pollutant specific toxic weighting factor (TWF). Not all pollutants have a toxic weighting factor(for example, Total Suspended Solids), which means that these pollutants do not have a toxicity score (i.e., TWPE = 0).

For Publicly Owned Treatment Works (POTWs), Major dischargers include all facilities with design flows equal to or greater than one million gallons per day, or serve a population of 10,000 or more, or cause significant water quality impacts. Non-POTW discharges are classified as Major facilities on the basis of the number of points accumulated using a Rating worksheet, which evaluates the significance of a facility using several criteria, including toxic pollutant potential, flow volume, and water quality factors such as impairment of the receiving water or proximity of the discharge to coastal waters.
