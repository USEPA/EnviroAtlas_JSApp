Wetland restoration could help restore these benefits.

This dataset was produced by the US EPA to support research and online mapping activities related to the EnviroAtlas.

Polygons for markets represent the entire region that shares market infrastructure and rules, or a larger program encompassing many smaller projects, such as habitat exchanges.

Polygons for markets represent the entire region that shares market infrastructure and rules, or a larger program encompassing many smaller projects, such as in-lieu fee programs.
