Wetland restoration could help restore these benefits. Potential wetland areas, as developed for this map, are lands that naturally accumulate water due to topography and have historically had poorly or very poorly draining soils. This dataset was produced by the US EPA to support research and online mapping activities related to the EnviroAtlas.
