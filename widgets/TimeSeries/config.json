It is a “peak-and-decline” scenario and assumes that greenhouse gas emissions peak between 2010 and 2020 with emissions declining substantially beyond 2020. The projected global warming increase compared to the reference period (1986-2005) is approximately 1.8 degree Fahrenheit (range of 0.54 to 3.06) by 2081-2100.
